# Code Refactor Starter Code
I notated sections in the HTML for ease of navigation.
I Consolidated styles in the .CSS file to help provide a logical context, as well as provided a class name of 'core' to represent the company's core principles, in order to help emphasize the benefits the company offers to their clients. I kept the color scheme offered by the company's design team, but I would urge that the 'core principles' = the 'benefits'. A slight change in color scheme here might highlight the benefit to your client.
