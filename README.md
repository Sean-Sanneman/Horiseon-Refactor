# Code Refactor Starter Code
Code refactor for Horiseon. Horiseon offers SEO services to their clients.

Work done:
I notated sections in the HTML for ease of navigation, and improved accessability.
I also Consolidated styles in the stylesheet by merging repeated code into a single class, .core, as well as making sure stylesheet follows semantic structure.
